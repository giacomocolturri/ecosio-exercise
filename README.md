# Ecosio exercise

1) Connect to an arbitrary website (http/s)
2) Search for all links on this site referring to other pages of the same domain (website) and collect them
3) For each collected link start over with (1) - we would like to see some multithreading here since network tends to be slow
4) When finished, output the full collection of links sorted by the link label

Result: collection of links for an arbitrary website
